           <h2 class="book-title"> I Was a Doctor in Auschwitz</h2>
            A truly striking book‚Ä¶<br>
           <br>
           Gisella holds nothing back and doesn‚Äôt sugarcoat anything in this book. She makes no compromises, neither with the morbid details nor with her bold statements. If someone wants to feel, taste, smell, hear, and see Auschwitz, there is no better way than through the words written by Gisella Perl in this book.<br>
           <br>
           I cried tears of sorrow along with the suffering of those in the camp. The way the doctor writes is immersive‚Äîit pulls you in completely.<br>
           <br>
           ‚ö† Warning: This book is not for the faint-hearted. There is so much death present in its pages that, at times, I had to take breaks because I simply couldn‚Äôt bear to think about death any longer. And that, in itself, showed me how horrifying the Nazis were‚Äîif I, just by reading, cannot stand thinking about death for too long, how could those who actually lived it endure? They lived death on their own skin, morning, noon, and night. It must have been unimaginable.<br>
           <br>
           The few moments of ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù sprinkled throughout the book added a beautiful contrast to the reading experience, showing me that the human will to live and empathy are stronger than the Nazis‚Äô destructive spirit.<br>
           <br>

          <h2 class="book-title">The Green Mile</h2>
          Now this is it! <br>
          <br> 
          The Green Mile is one of those books that doesn‚Äôt drown you in dull descriptions but instead pulls you straight into its world. It makes you see exactly why Stephen King is so famous‚Äîand why he fully deserves that fame.<br>
          <br>
          In this book, King locks you inside with the prisoners of the Green Mile. He has a way of gripping you, chapter by chapter, delivering just enough suspense to make your heart skip a beat at the end of each section. You devour the book, unable to stop, each second spent craving to know what happens next.<br>
          <br>
          The character development is so vivid that when I watched the movie, I instantly recognized every character without even hearing their names. That‚Äôs King for you‚Äîhe doesn‚Äôt just tell a story; he paints a movie inside your mind, and more often than not, it‚Äôs a damn good one.<br>
          <br>
          The story itself, though (spoiler alert) tragic, is one of those that sticks with you, standing tall alongside the Mr. Mercedes series.<br>
          <br>
          Because this book made me feel like I was locked inside that prison, because I felt every sharp pain of Paul‚Äôs infection, because I could smell the burning flesh of Delacroix,<br>
          <br>
          This book, without question, earns 5 stars. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

          <h2 class="book-title">A man called OVE</h2>
          5 STARS-Without a doubt.<br>
          <br>
          A wonderful book. It gave me everything‚Äîcomedy, tragedy, and emotions so strong I cried my heart out. I loved how beautifully Ove was portrayed, how every detail made him feel real, and how his layers unfolded one by one. And I absolutely adored Parvaneh‚Äîher energy, her kindness, the way she just barged into Ove‚Äôs world and refused to leave.<br>
          <br>
          This was my first Fredrik Backman book, but I know for sure it won‚Äôt be my last‚Äîhe completely won me over. His writing is effortless yet so powerful, making you feel every ounce of sorrow, joy, and nostalgia on the page.<br>
          <br>
          It‚Äôs also the first book that actually lived up to the promise on its cover‚Äîthat it would change the way I see grumpy old men. And it did. Ove‚Äôs story made me laugh, made me ache, and made me think, all at once.<br>
          <br>
          A wonderful book that gave me everything‚Äîcomedy, tragedy, and emotions so strong I cried my heart out. Ove is such a well-crafted character that you don‚Äôt just understand him‚Äîyou feel him. Every stubborn action, every grumble, every hidden sorrow makes him feel as real as anyone you might meet in life.<br>
          <br>
          And of course‚Ä¶ SAAB üíñ.<br>

          This book is a masterpiece. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

          <h2 class="book-title">In Order To Live</h2>
          A transformative must-read.<br>
          <br>
          I stumbled upon Joe Rogan‚Äôs podcast, ‚ÄúThe Joe Rogan Experience,‚Äù completely by chance. At first, I had no idea who the guest was until I learned she was Yeonmi Park‚Äîa brave escapee from North Korea. From the very first listen (and believe me, I‚Äôve replayed it more than once üòÑ), her words evoked the haunting atmosphere of Orwell‚Äôs 1984, a comparison she even makes in her book.<br>
          <br>
          Listening to her narrative felt like stepping into a world where every moment is a battle against unimaginable oppression. Life in North Korea, as Yeonmi describes it, mirrors the grim reality of Orwell‚Äôs dystopia‚Äîa reality so intense that, like reading 1984, it was initially almost too hard to digest. Every page of The Road to Freedom offers a lesson in resilience and courage, taking you on an emotional journey from relentless hardship to the fierce pursuit of liberty.<br>
          <br>
          ‚ö† Warning: This narrative is not for the faint-hearted. The raw depictions of struggle and survival may overwhelm you, yet they also highlight the incredible strength of the human spirit.<br>
          <br>
          The rare moments of hope interwoven with despair create a powerful contrast, making you appreciate every bit of freedom and compassion ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è<br>

          <h2 class="book-title">Under The Dome</h2>
          A captivating journey through a uniquely American landscape‚Ä¶<br>
          <br>
          Stephen King‚Äôs Under the Dome whisks you away to an America that‚Äôs raw and deeply familiar‚Äînot the crowded, polished version we often encounter, but a rugged, rural realm that only King can evoke. Even before turning the first page, I found myself yearning for that distinctive spirit, a longing only his stories can satisfy.<br>
          <br>
          The narrative moves with an exhilarating pace that sets it apart from many of his other works. King masterfully unveils the unfolding disaster from multiple perspectives. I‚Äôm especially eager to see how Junior‚Äôs storyline evolves, as his viewpoint promises to be the most intriguing. I also find myself wondering about the simmering conflicts between Junior and Barbara, and the mystery behind Dale‚Äôs unexpected role‚Äîa hint that these characters may yet converge in surprising ways as the plot thickens.<br>
          <br>
          I can‚Äôt help but ponder whether Big Jim‚Äôs rise to power will plunge the town into a tyranny that tips the balance in favor of evil. With every twist, the tension between hope and despair teeters on a knife‚Äôs edge. It‚Äôs fascinating how a seemingly innocuous dome transforms into an immediate harbinger of chaos, setting this tale apart from other disaster narratives.<br>
          <br>
          This book earns a solid 5 stars. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

          <h2 class="book-title">The Book Theif</h2>
          Before reading this book, I never imagined I‚Äôd find humor in death<br>
          <br>
          When I discovered that it was written from the perspective of death, I didn‚Äôt hesitate for a moment‚ÄîI had to buy it, utterly captivated by the fascinating premise.<br>
          <br>
          I‚Äôve read plenty of historical fiction, but this book stands out by portraying war as a constant, looming shadow over people‚Äôs lives‚Äînot the central focus, but an ever-present force, like a monster lurking under the bed that you can‚Äôt ignore. Yet, the narrative isn‚Äôt solely defined by the ravages of war, which I found incredibly refreshing.<br>
          <br>
          I also saw the film adaptation, which managed to capture much of the book‚Äôs essence brilliantly. If you‚Äôre looking for a story that reveals a different side of war, this is it. The tale of ‚ÄúThe Book Thief ‚Äì Lisel‚Äù even manages to capture death‚Äôs attention at a time when it was most preoccupied with the chaos of Hitler‚Äôs regime. With its well-drawn characters and unique charm, I‚Äôm sure it will captivate you too.<br>
          <br>
          This isn‚Äôt a depressing or sorrowful read‚Äîit‚Äôs full of humor, hope, and love. It makes you laugh and cry at the same time, reminding you to appreciate life and cherish every moment.<br>
          <br>
          I recommend this book with all my heart ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
