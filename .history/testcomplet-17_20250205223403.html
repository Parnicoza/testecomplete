Every word written here is an echo of the stories that have stayed with me, the worlds I’ve wandered through, and the characters who, in one way or another, have become a part of me.

           <h2 class="book-title"> I Was a Doctor in Auschwitz</h2>
            A truly striking book…<br>
           <br>
           Gisella holds nothing back and doesn’t sugarcoat anything in this book. She makes no compromises, neither with the morbid details nor with her bold statements. If someone wants to feel, taste, smell, hear, and see Auschwitz, there is no better way than through the words written by Gisella Perl in this book.<br>
           <br>
           I cried tears of sorrow along with the suffering of those in the camp. The way the doctor writes is immersive—it pulls you in completely.<br>
           <br>
           ⚠ Warning: This book is not for the faint-hearted. There is so much death present in its pages that, at times, I had to take breaks because I simply couldn’t bear to think about death any longer. And that, in itself, showed me how horrifying the Nazis were—if I, just by reading, cannot stand thinking about death for too long, how could those who actually lived it endure? They lived death on their own skin, morning, noon, and night. It must have been unimaginable.<br>
           <br>
           The few moments of “happiness” sprinkled throughout the book added a beautiful contrast to the reading experience, showing me that the human will to live and empathy are stronger than the Nazis’ destructive spirit.<br>
           <br>
           ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ GENIUS.

          <h2 class="book-title">The Green Mile</h2>
          Now this is it! <br>
          <br> 
          The Green Mile is one of those books that doesn’t drown you in dull descriptions but instead pulls you straight into its world. It makes you see exactly why Stephen King is so famous—and why he fully deserves that fame.<br>
          <br>
          In this book, King locks you inside with the prisoners of the Green Mile. He has a way of gripping you, chapter by chapter, delivering just enough suspense to make your heart skip a beat at the end of each section. You devour the book, unable to stop, each second spent craving to know what happens next.<br>
          <br>
          The character development is so vivid that when I watched the movie, I instantly recognized every character without even hearing their names. That’s King for you—he doesn’t just tell a story; he paints a movie inside your mind, and more often than not, it’s a damn good one.<br>
          <br>
          The story itself, though (spoiler alert) tragic, is one of those that sticks with you, standing tall alongside the Mr. Mercedes series.<br>
          <br>
          Because this book made me feel like I was locked inside that prison, because I felt every sharp pain of Paul’s infection, because I could smell the burning flesh of Delacroix,<br>
          <br>
          This book, without question, earns 5 stars. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

          <h2 class="book-title">A man called OVE</h2>
          5 STARS-Without a doubt.<br>
          <br>
          A wonderful book. It gave me everything—comedy, tragedy, and emotions so strong I cried my heart out. I loved how beautifully Ove was portrayed, how every detail made him feel real, and how his layers unfolded one by one. And I absolutely adored Parvaneh—her energy, her kindness, the way she just barged into Ove’s world and refused to leave.<br>
          <br>
          This was my first Fredrik Backman book, but I know for sure it won’t be my last—he completely won me over. His writing is effortless yet so powerful, making you feel every ounce of sorrow, joy, and nostalgia on the page.<br>
          <br>
          It’s also the first book that actually lived up to the promise on its cover—that it would change the way I see grumpy old men. And it did. Ove’s story made me laugh, made me ache, and made me think, all at once.<br>
          <br>
          A wonderful book that gave me everything—comedy, tragedy, and emotions so strong I cried my heart out. Ove is such a well-crafted character that you don’t just understand him—you feel him. Every stubborn action, every grumble, every hidden sorrow makes him feel as real as anyone you might meet in life.<br>
          <br>
          And of course… SAAB 💖.<br>
          <br>
          This book is a masterpiece. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

          <h2 class="book-title">In Order To Live</h2>
          A transformative must-read.<br>
          <br>
          I stumbled upon Joe Rogan’s podcast, “The Joe Rogan Experience,” completely by chance. At first, I had no idea who the guest was until I learned she was Yeonmi Park—a brave escapee from North Korea. From the very first listen (and believe me, I’ve replayed it more than once 😄), her words evoked the haunting atmosphere of Orwell’s 1984, a comparison she even makes in her book.<br>
          <br>
          Listening to her narrative felt like stepping into a world where every moment is a battle against unimaginable oppression. Life in North Korea, as Yeonmi describes it, mirrors the grim reality of Orwell’s dystopia—a reality so intense that, like reading 1984, it was initially almost too hard to digest. Every page of The Road to Freedom offers a lesson in resilience and courage, taking you on an emotional journey from relentless hardship to the fierce pursuit of liberty.<br>
          <br>
          ⚠ Warning: This narrative is not for the faint-hearted. The raw depictions of struggle and survival may overwhelm you, yet they also highlight the incredible strength of the human spirit.<br>
          <br>
          The rare moments of hope interwoven with despair create a powerful contrast, making you appreciate every bit of freedom and compassion ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️<br>

          <h2 class="book-title">Under The Dome</h2>
          A captivating journey through a uniquely American landscape…<br>
          <br>
          Stephen King’s Under the Dome whisks you away to an America that’s raw and deeply familiar—not the crowded, polished version we often encounter, but a rugged, rural realm that only King can evoke. Even before turning the first page, I found myself yearning for that distinctive spirit, a longing only his stories can satisfy.<br>
          <br>
          The narrative moves with an exhilarating pace that sets it apart from many of his other works. King masterfully unveils the unfolding disaster from multiple perspectives. I’m especially eager to see how Junior’s storyline evolves, as his viewpoint promises to be the most intriguing. I also find myself wondering about the simmering conflicts between Junior and Barbara, and the mystery behind Dale’s unexpected role—a hint that these characters may yet converge in surprising ways as the plot thickens.<br>
          <br>
          I can’t help but ponder whether Big Jim’s rise to power will plunge the town into a tyranny that tips the balance in favor of evil. With every twist, the tension between hope and despair teeters on a knife’s edge. It’s fascinating how a seemingly innocuous dome transforms into an immediate harbinger of chaos, setting this tale apart from other disaster narratives.<br>
          <br>
          This book earns a solid 5 stars. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

          <h2 class="book-title">The Book Theif</h2>
          Before reading this book, I never imagined I’d find humor in death<br>
          <br>
          When I discovered that it was written from the perspective of death, I didn’t hesitate for a moment—I had to buy it, utterly captivated by the fascinating premise.<br>
          <br>
          I’ve read plenty of historical fiction, but this book stands out by portraying war as a constant, looming shadow over people’s lives—not the central focus, but an ever-present force, like a monster lurking under the bed that you can’t ignore. Yet, the narrative isn’t solely defined by the ravages of war, which I found incredibly refreshing.<br>
          <br>
          I also saw the film adaptation, which managed to capture much of the book’s essence brilliantly. If you’re looking for a story that reveals a different side of war, this is it. The tale of “The Book Thief – Lisel” even manages to capture death’s attention at a time when it was most preoccupied with the chaos of Hitler’s regime. With its well-drawn characters and unique charm, I’m sure it will captivate you too.<br>
          <br>
          This isn’t a depressing or sorrowful read—it’s full of humor, hope, and love. It makes you laugh and cry at the same time, reminding you to appreciate life and cherish every moment.<br>
          <br>
          I recommend this book with all my heart ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
