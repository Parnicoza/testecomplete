                   <br>
                   The appetizer section sets the tone for your entire menu. Choose dishes that are light yet flavorful to stimulate the appetite without overwhelming your guests. Include a mix of textures and flavors—crispy, creamy, tangy, or savory—to appeal to a variety of tastes.
                   Don’t forget to consider portion sizes; appetizers should be small enough to leave room for the main courses but satisfying enough to impress on their own.

                    <br>
                    Main courses are the centerpiece of your menu. Choose dishes that are hearty, satisfying, and showcase the culinary identity of your restaurant. Offer a mix of proteins, vegetarian options, and signature specials.
                    Keep portions generous but balanced, and ensure every dish pairs well with your appetizers and sides to create a cohesive dining experience.
